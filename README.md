# Tumor Mutational Burden Prediction UI

Create a web-based tool to generate tumor mutational burden (TMB) predictions given user input of the mutation profiles of a small set of genes for a given tumor sample.  The underlying model is trained in a jupyter notebook, serialized with pickle, and served in the tool.
